# In this file you can define properties that are used for pre-processing
# the application archive during deploy or update.
#
# Properties in this file are in server-scope (specific for particular server)
# - if you want, you can also define properties on global and
# group-level. If same property is defined on several levels, the more
# specific level overrides less specific level.
#
# == How are these properties used? ==
# During pre-processing, LiveRebel will look for placeholders in configuration
# scripts and configuration files of the application (any text file) - if it
# finds a placeholder, it will replace it with a value defined either in this
# file or on global or group-level.
#
# == File format ==
# This file follows properties file syntax:
#   # this is a comment!
#   key=value
#
# For more details: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties
# (Unlike standard properties files, you can use UTF-8 in these files)
#
# == What kind of values would I typically define here? ==
# The most common scenario would be to define some properties that are specific
# for some server, for example path to a shared library. Typically you want to
# keep all your servers environment values the same (defined on group-level),
# but we have added this extra layer of flexibility for the unusual moments in life.
# So, if you have the common case of same environment values across the whole
# group, you can define them once on group-level (in group.properties file).
# And, if there are some values that you would like to be the same across all
# groups/environments, you can define them on global-level (stored in separate
# Git repo).
